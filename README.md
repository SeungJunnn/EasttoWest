# EasttoWest
Embed Eastern Faces to Western Faces using StyleGAN.

Original Codes from : 

https://github.com/Puzer/stylegan-encoder/

https://github.com/jacobhallberg/pytorch_stylegan_encoder

I used the pre-trained models from https://github.com/jacobhallberg/pytorch_stylegan_encoder/releases/tag/v1.0 . As mentioned, place the StyleGAN model in ./InterFaceGAN/models/pretrain/ . Place the Image To Latent model at the root of the repo.
